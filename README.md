# RevoMarket
College project for the 2nd half of the first quarter.

We had to learn JSF in Java.

The project is a homebroker like system integrated with our teacher's API for getting stoke quotes.

The investidor can sign up and it must pay some initial cash to be put on his balance. With it, he can search for stocks, buy them, track if they are more expensive or not and sell them. Profiting depending when he sells it, he also can see a history of his transactions.
